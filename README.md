Array
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. The following operations are implemented:

Insertion
Deletion
Accessing an element at a given index
Linked List
A linked list is a collection of elements called nodes, where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The following operations are implemented:

Insertion
Deletion
Traversing the list
Stack
A stack is a collection of elements where elements are added and removed from only one end, called the top. The following operations are implemented:

Pushing an element onto the stack
Popping an element off the stack
Peeking at the top element of the stack
Queue
A queue is a collection of elements where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front. The following operations are implemented:

Enqueuing an element into the queue
Dequeuing an element from the queue
Checking if the queue is empty
Checking if the queue is full
Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The following operations are implemented:

Insertion
Deletion
Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. The following operations are implemented:

Insertion
Deletion
Search
Heap
A heap is a binary tree data structure where the parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes (max heap), or where the parent node is always less than or equal to its child nodes (min heap). The following operations are implemented:

Insertion
Deletion
Heapify
Graph
A graph is a collection of vertices and edges, where each edge connects two vertices. The following operations are implemented:

Adding a vertex
Adding an edge
Removing a vertex
Removing an edge
Traversing the graph (BFS, DFS)
Algorithms
Sorting
Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order. The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Searching
Searching is the process of finding a specific element in a collection of elements. The following searching algorithms are implemented:

Linear Search
Binary Search
Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms are algorithms that operate
